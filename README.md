=========

This program modifies a text so as to bring it more into line with the expectations created by an ngram model.  It works by assuming that the text was generated by the model with a certain chance of "typos" occurring.  Based on this, it determines what the author is most likely to have "really" meant, with the typos removed.  It is basically a parody of autocorrect algorithms like the ones used in OCR.  The main differences are 1) this program will "correct" words even if they are proper English; and 2) it is tuned so as to be far more likely to make "corrections" than any real world autocorrector would be.

To run this, you will need to install [kenlm](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) and download
an ARPA-format language model (you can find some [here](http://www.keithv.com/software/csr/)).  The program can run as a Web application, or you can load it as a Python module and play with it on the command line.

For better performance, you may also want to convert the .arpa file into .binary format using KenLM's build_binary program.
